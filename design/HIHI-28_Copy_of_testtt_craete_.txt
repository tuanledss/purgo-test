1. Component Architecture
- Define the major components and their interactions:
  - **User Interface (UI) Module**: Handles user interactions and displays data. Interacts with the Application Logic Module to send user inputs and receive processed data.
  - **Application Logic Module**: Processes inputs from the UI, applies business rules, and interacts with the Data Access Layer. It serves as the core processing unit.
  - **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Manages data retrieval and storage. Interacts with the Database and external APIs to fetch and persist data.
  - **Database**: Stores application data in a structured format. Interacts with the DAL for data operations.
  - **External API Integration Module**: Manages communication with third-party services. Interacts with the Application Logic Module to send and receive data.

- Specify input/output interfaces:
  - **UI Module**: 
    - Input: User actions (e.g., clicks, form submissions)
    - Output: Rendered HTML/CSS, JSON data for dynamic content
  - **Application Logic Module**:
    - Input: JSON data from UI Module
    - Output: Processed JSON data to UI Module, SQL queries to DAL
  - **Data Access Layer**:
    - Input: SQL queries from Application Logic Module
    - Output: Result sets to Application Logic Module
  - **External API Integration Module**:
    - Input: API requests from Application Logic Module
    - Output: API responses to Application Logic Module

- Identify dependencies and external systems:
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular)
    - Backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django)
    - Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
    - Authentication service (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
  - **External Systems**:
    - Third-party APIs for data enrichment
    - Cloud storage services for file handling

2. Data Flow
- Detail the data transformation steps:
  - User input is captured by the UI Module and transformed into JSON format.
  - JSON data is sent to the Application Logic Module, where business rules are applied.
  - Transformed data is converted into SQL queries by the Application Logic Module and sent to the DAL.
  - The DAL executes queries and transforms result sets into JSON format.
  - JSON data is sent back to the Application Logic Module, processed, and then sent to the UI Module for rendering.

- Specify data formats and schemas:
  - **User Input JSON Schema**:
    
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "username": {"type": "string"},
        "password": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["username", "password"]
    }
    
  - **Database Schema**:
    - Users Table: `id (int), username (varchar), password_hash (varchar), email (varchar)`

- Define validation rules and error handling:
  - **Validation Rules**:
    - Username and password must not be empty.
    - Password must be at least 8 characters long.
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Invalid input: Return HTTP 400 with error message.
    - Database errors: Log error and return HTTP 500 with generic error message.

3. Implementation Steps
- Break down the development into concrete steps:
  1. Set up project structure and initialize version control.
  2. Develop the UI Module with form validation.
  3. Implement the Application Logic Module with business rules.
  4. Set up the Database and implement the DAL.
  5. Integrate External API Module and test API interactions.
  6. Conduct end-to-end testing and fix identified issues.

- Specify the order of implementation:
  - Start with project setup, followed by UI development, then backend logic, database setup, API integration, and finally testing.

- Define acceptance criteria for each step:
  - **UI Module**: Form validation works as expected, and data is correctly formatted as JSON.
  - **Application Logic Module**: Business rules are correctly applied, and data is transformed accurately.
  - **Data Access Layer**: SQL queries execute successfully, and data is retrieved/stored correctly.
  - **External API Integration**: API requests and responses are handled correctly.

4. Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements:
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for most operations.

- Security considerations:
  - Implement HTTPS for all data transmissions.
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Store passwords using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

- Scalability aspects:
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers and stateless application servers.
  - Use a distributed database system to handle increased data loads.
