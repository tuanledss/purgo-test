1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for processing requests from the UI, performing business logic, and interacting with the database.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores all persistent data.
  - **External API Integrator:** A component that handles communication with third-party services via their APIs.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** HTTP/HTTPS requests with JSON payloads for data submission and retrieval.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
  - **Backend to External API:** RESTful API calls with JSON payloads.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Authentication Service:** An external OAuth2 provider for user authentication.
  - **Payment Gateway:** An external service for processing payments.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service for sending emails and SMS notifications.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate data received from the UI before processing.
  - **Data Processing:** Transform validated data into the required format for business logic execution.
  - **Database Interaction:** Convert processed data into SQL queries for storage or retrieval.
  - **External API Communication:** Format data into JSON for API requests and handle responses.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **User Data:** JSON format with fields like `{"username": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string"}`.
  - **Database Schema:** Tables for users, transactions, and logs with appropriate data types and constraints.
  - **API Request/Response:** JSON format with fields specific to each external service's API documentation.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) and error messages in JSON format.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: UI Development**
  - Implement the user interface using React.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and can send requests to the backend.

- **Step 2: Backend Service Development**
  - Develop RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs respond correctly to requests with appropriate status codes and data.

- **Step 3: Database Setup**
  - Design and implement the database schema in PostgreSQL.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Database tables are created with correct relationships and constraints.

- **Step 4: External API Integration**
  - Implement communication with external services using Axios.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Successful data exchange with external APIs.

- **Step 5: Testing and Validation**
  - Perform unit and integration testing.
  - Acceptance Criteria: All tests pass with no critical bugs.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for API calls.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Implement HTTPS for all data transmission.
  - Use JWT for session management and OAuth2 for authentication.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
  - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across server instances.
