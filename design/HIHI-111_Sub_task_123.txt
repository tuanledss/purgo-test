#### 1. Component Architecture

- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **Data Loader:** Responsible for loading the white wine quality dataset from Databricks.
  - **Data Preprocessor:** Converts the 'quality' label into a binary variable 'high_quality' and splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
  - **Model Trainer:** Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to train a classification model.
  - **Model Validator and Tester:** Evaluates the model's performance on validation and test datasets.
  - **Experiment Tracker:** Uses MLflow to log model parameters, performance metrics, and save the trained model.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **Data Loader:**
    - Input: CSV file path (`/dbfs/FileStore/winequality-white.csv`)
    - Output: Pandas DataFrame
  - **Data Preprocessor:**
    - Input: Pandas DataFrame
    - Output: Preprocessed DataFrames for training, validation, and test sets
  - **Model Trainer:**
    - Input: Training DataFrame
    - Output: Trained Random Forest model
  - **Model Validator and Tester:**
    - Input: Validation and Test DataFrames
    - Output: Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
  - **Experiment Tracker:**
    - Input: Model parameters and metrics
    - Output: Logged experiments in MLflow

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Databricks:** For data storage and processing
  - **MLflow:** For experiment tracking and model management
  - **Scikit-learn:** For Random Forest implementation

#### 2. Data Flow

- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
  2. Convert 'quality' to 'high_quality' using a threshold (e.g., quality >= 7).
  3. Split the data into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test sets.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **Input DataFrame Schema:**
    - Columns: `fixed acidity`, `volatile acidity`, `citric acid`, `residual sugar`, `chlorides`, `free sulfur dioxide`, `total sulfur dioxide`, `density`, `pH`, `sulphates`, `alcohol`, `quality`
  - **Output DataFrame Schema:**
    - Columns: Same as input with 'quality' replaced by 'high_quality'

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - Ensure no missing values in the dataset.
  - Validate that the 'quality' column is converted correctly to 'high_quality'.
  - Handle errors in data loading and conversion with appropriate logging.

#### 3. Implementation Steps

- **Development Steps:**
  1. Implement the Data Loader to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
  2. Develop the Data Preprocessor to convert 'quality' to 'high_quality' and split the data.
  3. Implement the Model Trainer using Random Forest with default parameters.
  4. Develop the Model Validator and Tester to evaluate model performance.
  5. Set up MLflow for logging experiments and saving models.

- **Order of Implementation:**
  1. Data Loader
  2. Data Preprocessor
  3. Model Trainer
  4. Model Validator and Tester
  5. Experiment Tracker

- **Acceptance Criteria for Each Step:**
  - Data Loader: Successfully loads data into a DataFrame.
  - Data Preprocessor: Correctly converts and splits data.
  - Model Trainer: Trains a model without errors.
  - Model Validator and Tester: Achieves at least 80% accuracy on the test set.
  - Experiment Tracker: Logs all required parameters and metrics in MLflow.

#### 4. Technical Considerations

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The model should be trained and evaluated within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 30 minutes).

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Ensure data privacy by restricting access to the dataset and MLflow experiments.
  - Implement access controls for MLflow to manage permissions.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the pipeline to handle larger datasets by optimizing data loading and processing steps.
  - Ensure the model can be retrained with new data without significant changes to the pipeline.
