#### 1. Component Architecture

- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **Jupyter Notebook Interface:** The primary component where users will interact with the "Hello World" notebook.
  - **Python Kernel:** Executes the code within the notebook.
  - **Markdown Cells:** Used for documentation and explanation within the notebook.
  - **Code Cells:** Contain the executable Python code for the "Hello World" example.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **Input:** User inputs are not required for the basic "Hello World" notebook.
  - **Output:** The output will be the string "Hello, World!" displayed in the notebook.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Jupyter Notebook Environment:** Required to run the notebook.
  - **Python 3.x:** The programming language used for the notebook.
  - **No additional libraries** are required for the basic "Hello World" example.

#### 2. Data Flow

- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **Step 1:** User opens the Jupyter Notebook.
  - **Step 2:** The notebook initializes the Python kernel.
  - **Step 3:** The user runs the code cell containing the print statement.
  - **Step 4:** The Python kernel processes the print statement and outputs "Hello, World!".

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **Markdown Cells:** Text format for documentation.
  - **Code Cells:** Python code format.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rule:** Ensure the Python kernel is active before executing the code cell.
  - **Error Handling:** If the kernel is not active, display an error message prompting the user to start the kernel.

#### 3. Implementation Steps

- **Step 1: Set Up Jupyter Notebook Environment**
  - **Order:** First
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Jupyter Notebook is installed and can be launched successfully.

- **Step 2: Create a New Notebook**
  - **Order:** Second
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** A new notebook file is created and saved with an appropriate name, e.g., `HelloWorld.ipynb`.

- **Step 3: Add Markdown Cell for Introduction**
  - **Order:** Third
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** A markdown cell is added with a brief introduction to the notebook.

- **Step 4: Add Code Cell with "Hello, World!" Program**
  - **Order:** Fourth
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** A code cell is added with the following content:
    
    print("Hello, World!")
    

- **Step 5: Execute the Code Cell**
  - **Order:** Fifth
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The code cell runs without errors, and the output "Hello, World!" is displayed.

#### 4. Technical Considerations

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The notebook should load and execute the "Hello, World!" program within a few seconds.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Ensure the notebook environment is secure and does not allow execution of unauthorized code.
  - The notebook should not include any sensitive information.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - The notebook is designed for educational purposes and does not require scalability considerations for this simple example.
  - Future notebooks can build upon this by adding more complex examples and dependencies.
