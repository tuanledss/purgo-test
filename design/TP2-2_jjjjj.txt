1. Component Architecture
- Define the major components and their interactions:
  - **User Interface (UI) Component**: Responsible for capturing user input and displaying output. Interacts with the Application Logic component via RESTful API calls.
  - **Application Logic Component**: Processes input data, applies business rules, and interacts with the Data Storage component. It exposes endpoints for the UI and communicates with external systems.
  - **Data Storage Component**: Manages data persistence using a relational database. Interacts with the Application Logic component through SQL queries.
  - **External Systems**: Includes third-party APIs for additional data processing or retrieval. The Application Logic component handles these interactions.

- Specify input/output interfaces:
  - **UI Component**: 
    - Input: User input via forms (JSON format).
    - Output: Rendered HTML/CSS pages.
  - **Application Logic Component**:
    - Input: JSON payloads from UI and external systems.
    - Output: JSON responses to UI and data storage.
  - **Data Storage Component**:
    - Input: SQL queries from Application Logic.
    - Output: Query results in tabular format.

- Identify dependencies and external systems:
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Frontend framework (e.g., React)
    - Backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express)
    - Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
  - **External Systems**: 
    - Payment gateway API
    - Third-party authentication service

2. Data Flow
- Detail the data transformation steps:
  - User input is captured in the UI and sent as a JSON payload to the Application Logic.
  - Application Logic validates and transforms the data, applying business rules.
  - Transformed data is stored in the Data Storage component.
  - Data retrieval involves querying the database, transforming results into JSON, and sending them back to the UI.

- Specify data formats and schemas:
  - **User Input JSON Schema**:
    
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "username": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
        "password": {"type": "string", "minLength": 8}
      },
      "required": ["username", "email", "password"]
    }
    
  - **Database Schema**:
    - Users Table: `id (int)`, `username (varchar)`, `email (varchar)`, `password_hash (varchar)`

- Define validation rules and error handling:
  - Validate user input against JSON schema.
  - Handle errors by returning HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors).
  - Log errors with timestamps and error details for debugging.

3. Implementation Steps
- Break down the development into concrete steps:
  1. Set up project structure and initialize version control.
  2. Develop UI components and integrate with mock API.
  3. Implement Application Logic endpoints and connect to the database.
  4. Integrate external systems and handle API responses.
  5. Conduct end-to-end testing and fix identified issues.

- Specify the order of implementation:
  - Start with UI development, followed by backend logic, database integration, and finally external system integration.

- Define acceptance criteria for each step:
  - UI components should render correctly and handle user input.
  - Application Logic should process data and return expected results.
  - Database operations should perform CRUD operations successfully.
  - External system interactions should be reliable and handle errors gracefully.

4. Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements:
  - API response time should be under 200ms for standard operations.
  - UI should load within 2 seconds on average internet connections.

- Security considerations:
  - Implement HTTPS for all communications.
  - Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication with external systems.
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

- Scalability aspects:
  - Design the system to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
  - Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
  - Implement database sharding to manage large datasets efficiently.
