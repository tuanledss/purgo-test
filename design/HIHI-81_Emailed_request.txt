1. Component Architecture
- Define the major components and their interactions:
  - **User Interface (UI) Component**: Responsible for capturing user input and displaying output. Interacts with the Application Logic component via API calls.
  - **Application Logic Component**: Processes input data, applies business rules, and interacts with the Data Storage component. It serves as the intermediary between the UI and Data Storage.
  - **Data Storage Component**: Manages data persistence and retrieval. Interacts with the Application Logic component to store and fetch data.
  
- Specify input/output interfaces:
  - **UI Component**: 
    - Input: User actions (e.g., form submissions, button clicks)
    - Output: Rendered HTML/CSS, JSON responses
  - **Application Logic Component**:
    - Input: JSON requests from UI
    - Output: JSON responses to UI, SQL queries to Data Storage
  - **Data Storage Component**:
    - Input: SQL queries
    - Output: Query results in JSON format

- Identify dependencies and external systems:
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular)
    - Backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django)
    - Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
  - **External Systems**:
    - Authentication service (e.g., OAuth provider)
    - Third-party APIs for additional data (e.g., payment gateway)

2. Data Flow
- Detail the data transformation steps:
  - User input is captured by the UI and transformed into a JSON request.
  - The Application Logic component validates the JSON request, applies business rules, and transforms it into an SQL query.
  - The Data Storage component executes the SQL query and transforms the result into a JSON response.
  - The Application Logic component processes the JSON response and sends it back to the UI for rendering.

- Specify data formats and schemas:
  - **JSON Request/Response Schema**:
    
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "action": "string",
      "data": {
        "field1": "type",
        "field2": "type"
      }
    }
    
  - **SQL Schema**:
    
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
    );
    

- Define validation rules and error handling:
  - **Validation Rules**:
    - Ensure all required fields are present in the JSON request.
    - Validate data types and formats (e.g., email format, string length).
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Return HTTP 400 for validation errors with a detailed message.
    - Return HTTP 500 for server errors with a generic message.

3. Implementation Steps
- Break down the development into concrete steps:
  1. Set up the project structure and initialize version control.
  2. Implement the UI component with form validation.
  3. Develop the Application Logic component with API endpoints.
  4. Set up the Data Storage component and define the database schema.
  5. Integrate the components and perform end-to-end testing.

- Specify the order of implementation:
  - Begin with the Data Storage component to ensure data persistence.
  - Develop the Application Logic component to handle business rules.
  - Implement the UI component to capture and display data.

- Define acceptance criteria for each step:
  - **UI Component**: All forms should validate input and display error messages.
  - **Application Logic Component**: API endpoints should process requests and return correct responses.
  - **Data Storage Component**: Database operations should be successful and data should persist.

4. Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements:
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms.
  - Optimize database queries for speed and efficiency.

- Security considerations:
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.

- Scalability aspects:
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by adding more instances of the Application Logic component.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
