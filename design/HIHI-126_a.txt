      | Taiwind Config | default |
      | Unity Catalog Schema | purgo_playground |
      | Deployment Environment | development |

  Scenario Outline: Create Base React App with Taiwind Config
    Given the React version is "<React Version>"
    And the Taiwind configuration is "<Taiwind Config>"
    When the base React app is created
    Then the app should have the correct React version and Taiwind configuration
    And the app should be able to start without errors

    Examples:
      | React Version | Taiwind Config |
      | 18.2.0 | default |
      | 17.0.2 | custom |

  Scenario: Validate Unity Catalog Schema
    Given the Unity Catalog Schema is "purgo_playground"
    When the schema is validated
    Then the schema should be valid and match the expected structure

  Scenario Outline: Test Deployment and Hosting
    Given the deployment environment is "<Deployment Environment>"
    And the hosting requirements are "<Hosting Requirements>"
    When the app is deployed and hosted
    Then the app should be accessible and functional without errors

    Examples:
      | Deployment Environment | Hosting Requirements |
      | development | local |
      | production | cloud |

  Scenario: Error Handling - Missing Information
    Given the required information is missing
    When the app is created or deployed
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating the missing information
    And the app should not be created or deployed

  Scenario Outline: Error Handling - Invalid Configuration
    Given the Taiwind configuration is "<Taiwind Config>"
    And the configuration is invalid
    When the app is created
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating the invalid configuration
    And the app should not be created

    Examples:
      | Taiwind Config |
      | invalid |
      | missing |

  Scenario: Error Handling - Unity Catalog Schema Validation
    Given the Unity Catalog Schema is "purgo_playground"
