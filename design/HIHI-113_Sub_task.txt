1. Component Architecture
- Define the major components and their interactions:
  - **User Interface (UI) Component**: Responsible for capturing user input and displaying output. Interacts with the Application Logic component via RESTful API calls.
  - **Application Logic Component**: Processes input data, applies business rules, and interacts with the Data Storage component. It exposes endpoints for the UI and communicates with external systems.
  - **Data Storage Component**: Manages data persistence using a relational database. Interacts with the Application Logic component through SQL queries.
  - **External Systems**: Includes third-party APIs and services that the Application Logic component interacts with for additional data or processing.

- Specify input/output interfaces:
  - **UI Component**: 
    - Input: User actions (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).
    - Output: JSON responses containing data or error messages.
  - **Application Logic Component**:
    - Input: JSON requests from the UI.
    - Output: JSON responses to the UI, SQL queries to the Data Storage.
  - **Data Storage Component**:
    - Input: SQL queries from the Application Logic.
    - Output: Query results in tabular format.

- Identify dependencies and external systems:
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular).
    - Backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django).
    - Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
  - **External Systems**: 
    - Payment gateway API.
    - Authentication service (e.g., OAuth provider).

2. Data Flow
- Detail the data transformation steps:
  - User input is captured by the UI and transformed into a JSON request.
  - The Application Logic component validates the request, processes the data, and transforms it into SQL queries.
  - Data retrieved from the database is transformed into JSON responses for the UI.

- Specify data formats and schemas:
  - **JSON Request/Response Schema**:
    
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "action": "string",
      "data": {
        "field1": "string",
        "field2": "number"
      }
    }
    
  - **Database Schema**:
    - Table: `users`
      - Columns: `id (INT)`, `name (VARCHAR)`, `email (VARCHAR)`

- Define validation rules and error handling:
  - **Validation Rules**:
    - `userId` must be a valid UUID.
    - `action` must be one of the predefined actions (e.g., "create", "update").
    - `field2` must be a positive integer.
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Return HTTP 400 for validation errors with a descriptive message.
    - Log errors to a centralized logging system.

3. Implementation Steps
- Break down the development into concrete steps:
  1. Set up the project structure and initialize version control.
  2. Develop the UI component with form validation.
  3. Implement the Application Logic component with API endpoints.
  4. Design and create the database schema.
  5. Integrate the UI with the Application Logic component.
  6. Implement data persistence and retrieval in the Data Storage component.
  7. Integrate external systems and handle API interactions.
  8. Conduct end-to-end testing and validation.

- Specify the order of implementation:
  - Begin with the UI component, followed by the Application Logic, then the Data Storage, and finally external system integration.

- Define acceptance criteria for each step:
  - **UI Component**: All forms must validate input and display error messages.
  - **Application Logic**: All endpoints must return correct responses for valid and invalid requests.
  - **Data Storage**: Data must be correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
  - **External Systems**: Successful interaction with third-party APIs.

4. Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements:
  - The system must handle up to 1000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 200ms for API calls.

- Security considerations:
  - Implement HTTPS for all communications.
  - Use JWT for user authentication and authorization.
  - Sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

- Scalability aspects:
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
  - Use a distributed database system to handle increased data loads.
