1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for processing requests from the UI, interacting with the database, and performing business logic.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores all persistent data.
  - **External API Integrator:** A component that handles communication with third-party services via their APIs.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP. Example: `POST /api/v1/resource` with a JSON payload.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries executed via an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy).
  - **Backend to External API:** RESTful API calls using JSON payloads.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 provider for user authentication.
  - **Payment Gateway:** External service for processing payments.
  - **Notification Service:** Third-party service for sending emails and SMS.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **Step 1:** User input is validated and transformed into a JSON object.
  - **Step 2:** JSON object is sent to the backend, where it is parsed and mapped to a database entity.
  - **Step 3:** Data is processed and, if necessary, transformed into a format suitable for external API consumption.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **User Input JSON Schema:**
    
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "username": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
        "password": {"type": "string", "minLength": 8}
      },
      "required": ["username", "email", "password"]
    }
    

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:** Ensure all required fields are present and adhere to specified formats.
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP 400 with a detailed error message for validation failures. Log errors with a unique identifier for tracking.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: UI Development**
  - Implement the user interface using React.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and interact with mock APIs.

- **Step 2: Backend API Development**
  - Develop RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs return correct responses for valid and invalid requests.

- **Step 3: Database Integration**
  - Set up PostgreSQL database and implement data models using Sequelize ORM.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

- **Step 4: External API Integration**
  - Implement communication with external services using Axios.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Successful data exchange with third-party APIs.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 200ms for API calls.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Implement HTTPS for all communications.
  - Use JWT for session management and ensure tokens are securely stored.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
  - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
