1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for processing requests from the UI, performing business logic, and interacting with the database.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores all persistent data.
  - **Authentication Service:** An external service (e.g., OAuth 2.0 provider) for user authentication and authorization.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service (e.g., AWS SNS) for sending notifications to users.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for all API requests and responses.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **Backend to Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 protocol for user authentication.
  - **Backend to Notification Service:** JSON payloads over HTTPS for sending notifications.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **OAuth 2.0 Provider:** For user authentication.
  - **AWS SNS:** For sending notifications.
  - **PostgreSQL Database:** For data storage.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on the UI before sending to the backend.
  - **Data Processing:** Backend processes the data, applies business logic, and prepares it for storage or further actions.
  - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the database.
  - **Notification Trigger:** Based on certain conditions, notifications are sent to users.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **API Requests/Responses:** JSON format with defined schemas for each endpoint.
  - **Database Schema:** Tables with defined columns, data types, and constraints (e.g., `users`, `transactions`).

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Input Validation:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - **Error Handling:** Return standardized error codes and messages for different failure scenarios (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access).

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: Set Up Development Environment**
  - Install necessary tools and frameworks (e.g., Node.js, PostgreSQL).
  - Acceptance Criteria: Development environment is fully operational.

- **Step 2: Develop User Interface**
  - Implement UI components and integrate with backend APIs.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI is functional and can communicate with the backend.

- **Step 3: Implement Backend Service**
  - Develop RESTful APIs and integrate with the database.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs are functional and pass all unit tests.

- **Step 4: Integrate Authentication Service**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for user authentication.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate and access protected resources.

- **Step 5: Implement Notification Service**
  - Integrate with AWS SNS to send notifications.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully based on triggers.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 200ms for API requests.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  - Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers and stateless services.
  - Use database sharding or replication to handle increased data loads.
