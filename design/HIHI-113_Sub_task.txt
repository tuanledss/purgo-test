1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based interface for user interaction, built using React.js. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A Node.js application that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
  - **Database:** A PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.
  - **Authentication Service:** An external OAuth 2.0 service for user authentication.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service for sending email and SMS notifications.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with JSON payloads.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **Backend to Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 token exchange.
  - **Backend to Notification Service:** REST API calls with JSON payloads.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **React.js** for UI development.
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend development.
  - **PostgreSQL** for database management.
  - **OAuth 2.0** for authentication.
  - **SendGrid** or similar for email notifications.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input:** Data is collected from the UI and sent to the backend.
  - **Data Validation:** Backend validates the data against predefined schemas.
  - **Data Processing:** Business logic is applied to the validated data.
  - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the database.
  - **Notification Trigger:** If applicable, notifications are sent via the Notification Service.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **JSON** for data exchange between UI and backend.
  - **SQL** for database interactions.
  - **Example JSON Schema:**
    
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "userId": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
        "message": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["userId", "email"]
    }
    

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP 400 for validation errors, HTTP 500 for server errors, and log errors for monitoring.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: UI Development**
  - Implement the React.js components.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and handle user input.

- **Step 2: Backend API Development**
  - Develop RESTful endpoints in Node.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Endpoints return correct responses for valid and invalid requests.

- **Step 3: Database Schema Design**
  - Create tables and relationships in PostgreSQL.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Database schema supports all required data operations.

- **Step 4: Integration with Authentication Service**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate and receive valid tokens.

- **Step 5: Notification Service Integration**
  - Implement API calls to the Notification Service.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully upon triggering events.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for API calls.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  - Store passwords securely using bcrypt hashing.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers.
  - Use database sharding or replication to handle increased data loads.
