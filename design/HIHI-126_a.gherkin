Feature: Unity Catalog Schema Analysis

  Background:
    Given the Unity Catalog Schema "purgo_playground" is available
    And the schema details are provided, including table structures, relationships, and data types
    And the attachments and context are available for analysis

  Scenario: Successful Analysis with Complete Information
    Given the schema details are complete and accurate
    And the attachments and context are relevant and sufficient
    When the analysis is performed with the provided information
    Then the analysis should be successful
    And the results should be accurate and comprehensive

  Scenario Outline: Analysis with Missing Information
    Given the schema details are <schema_details_status>
    And the attachments and context are <attachments_context_status>
    When the analysis is performed with the provided information
    Then the analysis should <analysis_result>
    And the error message should be <error_message>

    Examples:
      | schema_details_status | attachments_context_status | analysis_result | error_message |
      | incomplete            | available                  | fail            | "Schema details are incomplete" |
      | complete              | missing                    | fail            | "Attachments and context are missing" |
      | missing               | available                  | fail            | "Schema details are missing" |
      | complete              | incomplete                 | fail            | "Attachments and context are incomplete" |

  Scenario: Successful Schema Validation
    Given the schema details are complete and accurate
    When the schema is validated against the provided data
    Then the schema should be valid
    And the validation results should be accurate and comprehensive

  Scenario Outline: Schema Validation Errors
    Given the schema details are complete and accurate
    And the data contains <error_type> errors
    When the schema is validated against the provided data
    Then the schema validation should <validation_result>
    And the error message should be <error_message>

    Examples:
      | error_type | validation_result | error_message |
      | data type  | fail               | "Data type mismatch" |
      | format     | fail               | "Invalid data format" |
      | relationship | fail              | "Invalid relationship between tables" |

  Scenario: Successful Data Modeling
    Given the schema details are complete and accurate
    And the data modeling considerations are taken into account
    When the data modeling is performed
    Then the data modeling should be successful
    And the results should be accurate and comprehensive

  Scenario Outline: Data Modeling Errors
    Given the schema details are complete and accurate
    And the data modeling considerations are <considerations_status>
    When the data modeling is performed
    Then the data modeling should <modeling_result>
    And the error message should be <error_message>

    Examples:
      | considerations_status | modeling_result | error_message |
      | ignored               | fail            | "Data modeling considerations ignored" |
      | incomplete            | fail            | "Data modeling considerations are incomplete" |
