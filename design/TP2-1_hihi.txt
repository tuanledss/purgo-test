#### 1. Component Architecture

- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **Data Loader:** Loads the white wine quality dataset from Databricks.
  - **Data Preprocessor:** Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Converts the 'quality' label into a binary variable 'high_quality'.
  - **Model Trainer:** Implements the Random Forest algorithm to train a classification model.
  - **Model Validator and Tester:** Evaluates the model's accuracy on validation and test datasets.
  - **Experiment Tracker:** Utilizes MLflow to log model parameters, performance metrics, and save the trained model.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **Data Loader:**
    - Input: CSV file path (`/dbfs/FileStore/winequality-white.csv`)
    - Output: Pandas DataFrame
  - **Data Preprocessor:**
    - Input: DataFrame
    - Output: Preprocessed DataFrame with 'high_quality' label
  - **Model Trainer:**
    - Input: Training DataFrame
    - Output: Trained Random Forest model
  - **Model Validator and Tester:**
    - Input: Validation and Test DataFrames
    - Output: Accuracy metrics
  - **Experiment Tracker:**
    - Input: Model parameters and metrics
    - Output: MLflow logs and registered model

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Databricks:** For data storage and processing.
  - **MLflow:** For experiment tracking and model management.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For implementing the Random Forest algorithm.

#### 2. Data Flow

- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
  2. Convert 'quality' to 'high_quality' using a threshold (e.g., quality >= 7).
  3. Split the dataset into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test sets.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **Input DataFrame Schema:**
    - Columns: `fixed acidity`, `volatile acidity`, `citric acid`, `residual sugar`, `chlorides`, `free sulfur dioxide`, `total sulfur dioxide`, `density`, `pH`, `sulphates`, `alcohol`, `quality`
  - **Output DataFrame Schema:**
    - Columns: Same as input with 'quality' replaced by 'high_quality' (binary)

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - Ensure all columns are present in the dataset.
  - Validate that 'quality' is an integer between 0 and 10.
  - Handle missing values by either imputing or removing rows.
  - Log errors in MLflow if data validation fails.

#### 3. Implementation Steps

- **Step 1: Data Loading**
  - Implement the data loading function using Pandas.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Data is successfully loaded into a DataFrame.

- **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
  - Implement the conversion of 'quality' to 'high_quality'.
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Data is preprocessed and split correctly.

- **Step 3: Model Training**
  - Implement the Random Forest training using Scikit-learn.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Model is trained without errors.

- **Step 4: Model Validation and Testing**
  - Evaluate the model on validation and test datasets.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Model achieves at least 80% accuracy on the test dataset.

- **Step 5: Experiment Tracking**
  - Set up MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and the model.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** All experiments are logged in MLflow.

#### 4. Technical Considerations

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The model should be trained and evaluated within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 30 minutes for the entire pipeline).

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Ensure data is accessed securely from Databricks.
  - Use secure connections for MLflow logging.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - The pipeline should be designed to handle larger datasets by leveraging Databricks' distributed computing capabilities.
  - Consider parallelizing the Random Forest training if necessary.
