1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based interface for user interaction, built using React.js. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A Node.js application that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
  - **Database:** A PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.
  - **Authentication Service:** An external OAuth 2.0 service for user authentication.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service for sending email and SMS notifications.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with JSON payloads.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **Backend to Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 token exchange.
  - **Backend to Notification Service:** REST API calls with JSON payloads.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **React.js** for the frontend framework.
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend server.
  - **PostgreSQL** for the database.
  - **OAuth 2.0** for authentication.
  - **Twilio** for SMS notifications and **SendGrid** for email notifications.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input:** Data is collected from the UI and sent to the backend in JSON format.
  - **Backend Processing:** Data is validated, transformed, and stored in the database.
  - **Data Retrieval:** Data is fetched from the database, transformed into JSON, and sent to the UI.
  - **Notification Trigger:** Upon certain events, data is formatted and sent to the Notification Service.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **User Data:** JSON schema with fields like `userId`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`.
  - **Notification Data:** JSON schema with fields like `recipient`, `message`, `type`.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) with error messages in JSON format.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: Set Up Development Environment**
  - Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and React.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Development environment is fully operational.

- **Step 2: Develop Backend Service**
  - Implement RESTful API endpoints using Express.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: All endpoints return expected responses with correct status codes.

- **Step 3: Implement Database Schema**
  - Design and create tables in PostgreSQL.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Database schema matches the specified design.

- **Step 4: Develop User Interface**
  - Build React components for user interaction.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and interact with the backend.

- **Step 5: Integrate Authentication Service**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow in the backend.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate and receive tokens.

- **Step 6: Implement Notification Service**
  - Integrate with Twilio and SendGrid for notifications.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully upon triggering events.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Backend should handle up to 1000 concurrent requests.
  - Database queries should execute within 200ms.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Store passwords as hashed values using bcrypt.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by adding more instances of the backend service.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across backend instances.
