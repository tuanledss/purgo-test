1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for processing requests from the UI, performing business logic, and interacting with the database.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores all persistent data.
  - **Authentication Service:** An external service (e.g., OAuth 2.0 provider) for user authentication and authorization.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service (e.g., AWS SNS) for sending notifications to users.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** HTTP/HTTPS requests with JSON payloads for data submission and retrieval.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
  - **Backend to Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 protocol for user authentication.
  - **Backend to Notification Service:** REST API calls with JSON payloads for sending notifications.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **OAuth 2.0 Provider:** For user authentication.
  - **AWS SNS:** For sending notifications.
  - **PostgreSQL Database:** For data storage.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate data received from the UI before processing.
  - **Data Processing:** Apply business logic to validated data.
  - **Data Storage:** Store processed data in the database.
  - **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from the database for UI display.
  - **Notification Triggering:** Send notifications based on specific events.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **JSON:** Used for data exchange between UI and backend.
  - **SQL:** Used for data manipulation in the database.
  - **User Data Schema:** 
    
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "role": "string"
    }
    

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:**
    - Email must be a valid email format.
    - User ID must be a non-empty string.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Return HTTP 400 for validation errors with a descriptive message.
    - Log errors to a centralized logging system.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: Set Up Database**
  - Create database schema and tables.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Database is accessible and schema is correctly set up.

- **Step 2: Develop Backend Service**
  - Implement RESTful APIs for data processing.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs are functional and pass all unit tests.

- **Step 3: Integrate Authentication Service**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate and receive tokens.

- **Step 4: Develop User Interface**
  - Implement UI components for data input and display.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI is responsive and integrates with backend APIs.

- **Step 5: Implement Notification Service**
  - Integrate with AWS SNS for sending notifications.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully on trigger events.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Backend should handle up to 1000 concurrent requests.
  - Database queries should execute within 200ms.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all data transmission.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design backend to be stateless to allow horizontal scaling.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
