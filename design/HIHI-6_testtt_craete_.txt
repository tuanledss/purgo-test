1. Component Architecture
- Define the major components and their interactions:
  - **Component A**: Responsible for data ingestion and initial processing.
  - **Component B**: Handles data transformation and business logic application.
  - **Component C**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
  - **Component D**: Provides user interface and interaction.
  - **Interactions**: Component A feeds processed data to Component B, which then stores results in Component C. Component D retrieves data from Component C for display.

- Specify input/output interfaces:
  - **Component A**: 
    - Input: Raw data in JSON format via REST API.
    - Output: Processed data in XML format to Component B.
  - **Component B**:
    - Input: XML data from Component A.
    - Output: Transformed data in CSV format to Component C.
  - **Component C**:
    - Input: CSV data from Component B.
    - Output: Data accessible via SQL queries.
  - **Component D**:
    - Input: SQL query results from Component C.
    - Output: HTML/CSS rendered pages for user interaction.

- Identify dependencies and external systems:
  - **External System 1**: Authentication service for user verification.
  - **External System 2**: Third-party API for additional data enrichment.

2. Data Flow
- Detail the data transformation steps:
  - Step 1: Data ingestion in Component A, converting JSON to XML.
  - Step 2: XML data transformation in Component B, applying business rules.
  - Step 3: Conversion of transformed data to CSV in Component B.
  - Step 4: Storage of CSV data in Component C's database.

- Specify data formats and schemas:
  - **JSON Schema**: `{ "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "value": { "type": "number" } } }`
  - **XML Schema**: `<schema><element name="data" type="string"/><element name="value" type="decimal"/></schema>`
  - **CSV Format**: `id,value`

- Define validation rules and error handling:
  - **Validation Rule 1**: Ensure all JSON inputs have non-null "id" and "value".
  - **Validation Rule 2**: XML must conform to defined schema.
  - **Error Handling**: Log errors to a centralized system and notify via email for critical failures.

3. Implementation Steps
- Break down the development into concrete steps:
  - Step 1: Develop Component A with REST API for JSON ingestion.
  - Step 2: Implement XML conversion and validation in Component A.
  - Step 3: Develop Component B for XML transformation and CSV conversion.
  - Step 4: Set up Component C with database schema and storage logic.
  - Step 5: Create Component D for user interface and data display.

- Specify the order of implementation:
  - Begin with Component A, followed by Component B, then Component C, and finally Component D.

- Define acceptance criteria for each step:
  - **Component A**: Successfully ingests and converts JSON to XML.
  - **Component B**: Accurately transforms XML to CSV with business logic applied.
  - **Component C**: Stores and retrieves data correctly via SQL.
  - **Component D**: Displays data accurately and responsively in the UI.

4. Technical Considerations
- Performance requirements:
  - System must handle 1000 requests per second with a response time under 200ms.

- Security considerations:
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256.

- Scalability aspects:
  - Use microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of components.
  - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
