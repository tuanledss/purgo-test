1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A RESTful API service built using Node.js that handles business logic and data processing. It interacts with the database and external services.
  - **Database:** A PostgreSQL database that stores user data, application data, and logs.
  - **External Authentication Service:** An OAuth 2.0 compliant service for user authentication.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service for sending email and SMS notifications.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for all API requests and responses.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **Backend to External Services:** JSON over HTTP for authentication and notifications.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Node.js and Express.js** for backend development.
  - **React.js** for frontend development.
  - **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
  - **OAuth 2.0** for authentication.
  - **SMTP/Third-party API** for email notifications.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on the UI before sending to the backend.
  - **Data Processing:** Backend processes data, applies business logic, and prepares it for storage or further action.
  - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the database.
  - **Notification Trigger:** Upon certain actions, notifications are sent via the Notification Service.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **User Data:** JSON format with fields like `username`, `email`, `password`.
  - **Database Schema:** Tables for `users`, `transactions`, `logs` with appropriate fields and data types.
  - **API Responses:** JSON format with fields like `status`, `message`, `data`.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Input Validation:** Ensure all required fields are present and valid (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) with error messages in JSON format.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: Setup Development Environment**
  - Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and necessary libraries.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Development environment is fully operational.

- **Step 2: Develop Backend API**
  - Implement RESTful endpoints for user management and data processing.
  - Acceptance Criteria: All endpoints return expected responses and handle errors gracefully.

- **Step 3: Develop Frontend UI**
  - Create React components for user interaction.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI is responsive and communicates correctly with the backend.

- **Step 4: Integrate Authentication**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate and access protected resources.

- **Step 5: Implement Notification Service**
  - Integrate with external service for sending notifications.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully upon triggering events.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - API should handle up to 1000 requests per second.
  - Database queries should execute within 200ms.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers.
  - Use database sharding and replication for handling large datasets.
