1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based interface for user interaction. It will communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
  - **Database:** A relational database to store and manage data.
  - **External API Integration:** Interfaces with third-party services for additional data or functionality.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for data submission and retrieval.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data manipulation.
  - **Backend to External APIs:** RESTful API calls using JSON.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Frameworks:** React for UI, Node.js for backend.
  - **Database System:** PostgreSQL.
  - **External APIs:** Integration with a third-party payment gateway.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate data on the client-side before submission.
  - **Data Processing:** Backend processes data, applies business logic, and prepares it for storage or further API calls.
  - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the database.
  - **Data Retrieval:** Data is fetched from the database and transformed into a suitable format for the UI.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **JSON Schema for API Requests/Responses:** Define the structure of data exchanged between UI and backend.
  - **Database Schema:** Tables for users, transactions, and logs with defined relationships and constraints.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Client-Side Validation:** Ensure all required fields are filled and data types are correct.
  - **Server-Side Validation:** Re-validate data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks in the backend to handle exceptions and return meaningful error messages.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: Setup Development Environment**
  - Install necessary tools and frameworks.
  - Acceptance Criteria: All team members can run a basic "Hello World" application.

- **Step 2: Develop UI Components**
  - Create React components for user interaction.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and handle user input.

- **Step 3: Implement Backend Services**
  - Develop RESTful APIs using Node.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs respond correctly to requests and perform expected operations.

- **Step 4: Database Design and Integration**
  - Design database schema and implement using PostgreSQL.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Data can be stored and retrieved accurately.

- **Step 5: External API Integration**
  - Implement integration with third-party services.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Successful data exchange with external APIs.

- **Step 6: Testing and Validation**
  - Conduct unit and integration tests.
  - Acceptance Criteria: All tests pass with no critical issues.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  - Use JWT for user authentication and authorization.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by adding more instances of the backend service.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across backend instances.
