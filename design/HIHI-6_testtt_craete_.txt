1. Component Architecture
   - **Major Components and Interactions:**
     - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based interface for user interaction. It will communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs.
     - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for business logic, data processing, and communication with external systems.
     - **Database:** A relational database to store persistent data.
     - **External Systems:** Integration with third-party services for additional functionalities (e.g., payment processing, authentication).

   - **Input/Output Interfaces:**
     - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for API requests and responses.
     - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and storage.
     - **Backend to External Systems:** RESTful API calls with JSON payloads.

   - **Dependencies and External Systems:**
     - **Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
     - **Payment Gateway:** Integration with a third-party payment processor.
     - **Logging Service:** External logging service for monitoring and error tracking.

2. Data Flow
   - **Data Transformation Steps:**
     - **User Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on the UI before sending to the backend.
     - **Data Processing:** Backend processes data, applies business logic, and prepares it for storage or external API calls.
     - **Response Handling:** Format and send responses back to the UI or external systems.

   - **Data Formats and Schemas:**
     - **API Requests/Responses:** JSON format with defined schemas for each endpoint.
     - **Database Schema:** Relational tables with defined columns, data types, and constraints.

   - **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
     - **Input Validation:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
     - **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks in the backend to handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).

3. Implementation Steps
   - **Step 1: Setup Development Environment**
     - Install necessary tools and frameworks.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Development environment is fully operational.

   - **Step 2: Develop User Interface**
     - Create UI components and integrate with backend APIs.
     - Acceptance Criteria: UI is functional and communicates with the backend.

   - **Step 3: Implement Backend Services**
     - Develop API endpoints and business logic.
     - Acceptance Criteria: All endpoints are implemented and pass unit tests.

   - **Step 4: Integrate Database**
     - Design and implement database schema.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Database is operational and integrated with the backend.

   - **Step 5: Connect External Systems**
     - Implement integration with authentication and payment services.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Successful communication with external systems.

4. Technical Considerations
   - **Performance Requirements:**
     - Ensure API response times are under 200ms for 95% of requests.
     - Optimize database queries for efficiency.

   - **Security Considerations:**
     - Use HTTPS for all communications.
     - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

   - **Scalability Aspects:**
     - Design the system to handle increased load by scaling horizontally.
     - Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
