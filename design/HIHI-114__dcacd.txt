1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to interact with the system. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
  - **Backend Service:** A server-side application responsible for processing requests from the UI, interacting with the database, and performing business logic.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores all persistent data.
  - **External API Integrator:** A component that handles communication with third-party APIs for data retrieval and updates.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for all API requests and responses.
  - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
  - **Backend to External API:** RESTful API calls using JSON format.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Authentication Service:** An external OAuth2 provider for user authentication.
  - **Payment Gateway:** An external service for processing payments.
  - **Notification Service:** An external service for sending emails and SMS notifications.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  - **User Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on the UI before sending to the backend.
  - **Data Processing:** Backend processes the data, applies business logic, and prepares it for storage or external API calls.
  - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the database.
  - **Data Retrieval:** Data is fetched from the database, transformed into the required format, and sent back to the UI.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **User Data:** JSON format with fields like `userId`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`.
  - **Transaction Data:** JSON format with fields like `transactionId`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) with error messages in JSON format.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: UI Development**
  - Implement the user interface using React.js.
  - Acceptance Criteria: UI components render correctly and validate inputs before submission.

- **Step 2: Backend API Development**
  - Develop RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
  - Acceptance Criteria: APIs respond with correct data and handle errors gracefully.

- **Step 3: Database Schema Design**
  - Design and implement the database schema in PostgreSQL.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Database tables are normalized and support all required queries.

- **Step 4: External API Integration**
  - Implement integration with external APIs for authentication and payment processing.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Successful authentication and payment transactions.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for API calls.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  - Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers and stateless backend services.
  - Use database sharding and replication to handle increased data loads.
