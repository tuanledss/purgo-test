1. **Component Architecture**
   - **Major Components and Interactions:**
     - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based interface for user interaction. It will communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs.
     - **Backend Service:** A Node.js application that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
     - **Database:** A PostgreSQL database to store and manage application data.
     - **Authentication Service:** An external OAuth 2.0 provider for user authentication.
     - **Notification Service:** An external service (e.g., Twilio) for sending notifications.

   - **Input/Output Interfaces:**
     - **UI to Backend:** JSON over HTTP for API requests and responses.
     - **Backend to Database:** SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
     - **Backend to Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 protocol for user authentication.
     - **Backend to Notification Service:** REST API calls for sending notifications.

   - **Dependencies and External Systems:**
     - **Node.js and Express.js** for backend development.
     - **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
     - **OAuth 2.0 provider** for authentication.
     - **Twilio API** for notifications.

2. **Data Flow**
   - **Data Transformation Steps:**
     - **User Input:** Data is collected from the UI and sent to the backend.
     - **Data Validation:** Backend validates the input data against predefined schemas.
     - **Data Processing:** Business logic is applied to the validated data.
     - **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the PostgreSQL database.
     - **Notification Trigger:** If applicable, a notification is sent via the Notification Service.

   - **Data Formats and Schemas:**
     - **User Input Schema:** JSON format with fields such as `username`, `password`, `email`.
     - **Database Schema:** Tables for `users`, `transactions`, `notifications` with appropriate fields and data types.

   - **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
     - **Validation Rules:** Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted. For example, `email` must be a valid email address.
     - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized) with error messages in JSON format.

3. **Implementation Steps**
   - **Step 1: Setup Project Environment**
     - Install Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Development environment is fully set up and operational.

   - **Step 2: Develop Backend APIs**
     - Implement RESTful APIs for user management and data processing.
     - Acceptance Criteria: All APIs are functional and pass unit tests.

   - **Step 3: Integrate Authentication Service**
     - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate using the external provider.

   - **Step 4: Develop User Interface**
     - Create a responsive web UI using React.js.
     - Acceptance Criteria: UI is fully functional and integrates with backend APIs.

   - **Step 5: Implement Notification Service**
     - Integrate Twilio API for sending notifications.
     - Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are sent successfully based on triggers.

   - **Step 6: Testing and Validation**
     - Conduct end-to-end testing and validate against acceptance criteria.
     - Acceptance Criteria: All tests pass and system meets specified requirements.

4. **Technical Considerations**
   - **Performance Requirements:**
     - The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for API calls.

   - **Security Considerations:**
     - Use HTTPS for all communications.
     - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
     - Store passwords securely using bcrypt hashing.

   - **Scalability Aspects:**
     - Design the system to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers and containerization (e.g., Docker).
     - Use database sharding and indexing to optimize query performance.
