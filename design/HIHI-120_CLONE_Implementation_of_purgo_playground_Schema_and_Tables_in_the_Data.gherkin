Feature: SQL Script Execution for purgo_playground Schema

  As a database developer,
  I need to execute an SQL script that creates the purgo_playground schema and its associated tables in the database.
  The script should also drop existing tables if they are present to ensure the structure meets the application's requirements.

  Background:
    Given the database is accessible
    And the SQL script is available

  Scenario: Create purgo_playground schema
