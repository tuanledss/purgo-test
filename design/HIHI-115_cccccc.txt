1. Component Architecture
- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** A web-based front-end application that allows users to input data and view results. Interacts with the API Gateway.
  - **API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point for all client requests. Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
  - **Data Processing Service:** Handles data transformation and processing. Interacts with the Database and External APIs.
  - **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing processed data and user information.
  - **External APIs:** Third-party services that provide additional data required for processing.

- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **UI to API Gateway:** HTTP/HTTPS requests with JSON payloads.
  - **API Gateway to Data Processing Service:** RESTful API calls with JSON data.
  - **Data Processing Service to Database:** SQL queries for data storage and retrieval.
  - **Data Processing Service to External APIs:** RESTful API calls with JSON responses.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Authentication Service:** For user authentication and authorization.
  - **External Data Providers:** APIs providing supplementary data.

2. Data Flow
- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  1. **Data Collection:** User inputs are collected via the UI and sent to the API Gateway.
  2. **Data Validation:** API Gateway validates the input data against predefined schemas.
  3. **Data Processing:** Data Processing Service transforms the data, applying business rules and logic.
  4. **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in the Database.
  5. **Data Retrieval:** Data is retrieved from the Database for display on the UI.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **Input Data Schema:** JSON format with fields such as `userId`, `inputData`, `timestamp`.
  - **Processed Data Schema:** JSON format with fields such as `processedDataId`, `userId`, `result`, `status`.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:** Ensure `userId` is a valid UUID, `inputData` is non-empty, and `timestamp` is a valid ISO 8601 date.
  - **Error Handling:** Return HTTP 400 for validation errors, HTTP 500 for internal server errors, and log all errors with stack traces.

3. Implementation Steps
- **Step 1: UI Development**
  - Implement the web-based UI using React.js.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** UI should allow data input and display results.

- **Step 2: API Gateway Setup**
  - Configure API Gateway using AWS API Gateway.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** API Gateway should route requests to the Data Processing Service.

- **Step 3: Data Processing Service Development**
  - Develop the service using Node.js and Express.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Service should process data and interact with the Database and External APIs.

- **Step 4: Database Configuration**
  - Set up PostgreSQL database with necessary tables and schemas.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Database should store and retrieve data correctly.

- **Step 5: Integration and Testing**
  - Integrate all components and perform end-to-end testing.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** System should function as expected with no critical bugs.

4. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - System should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for API calls.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Implement HTTPS for all data transmissions.
  - Use JWT for user authentication and authorization.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the system to be horizontally scalable, particularly the API Gateway and Data Processing Service.
  - Use AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic resource allocation based on load.
